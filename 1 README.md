# Stats501-Final-Project-MISO-Electricity-Prediction
This study evaluates machine learning approaches for predicting electricity prices in Minnesota's grid to optimize energy storage arbitrage. 
Using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models trained on weather, generation mix, and historical price data, the analysis demonstrates potential for improving price forecasting accuracy.

# TO Run the Model
To run this model, you must first run the load data_python-Copy1.ipynb code to generate the Minnesota specific data tables and to analyze each table of data before performing the analysis.

Once this file is run and interpreted, then you can run the second python script "2 MISO Price Predictor.ipynb" to get the results from the machine learning models.
